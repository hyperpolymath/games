## Overview

**Phantom Metal Taste** is an advanced multi-model database architecture designed to capture, analyze, and visualize the complex relationship between corporate initiatives and their outcomes.

The project leverages cutting-edge graph and semantic database technologies to model organizational dynamics with unprecedented fidelity, revealing patterns that traditional relational databases cannot express.

> *"The taste of metal in your mouth when nothing is there—a phantom sensation that feels undeniably real yet fundamentally wrong."*

## Technical Architecture

This project employs a sophisticated stack:

- **ArangoDB**: For graph-based modeling of causal relationships
- **Virtuoso**: For semantic web ontologies and formal knowledge representation
- **ReScript/Deno**: For orchestration and API layer
- **Rust/WebAssembly**: For high-performance core logic
- **Julia**: For advanced statistical analysis

## The SynapCor Case Study

Included with this project is a complete case study of "SynapCor," a fictional tech company implementing a data-driven employee wellness program called the "Synergy Matrix." The case study includes:

- Full UML modeling suite (Use Case, Sequence, State Machine diagrams)
- TOGAF-compliant enterprise architecture documentation
- OMG Ontology Definition Metamodel implementation
- Data Flow Diagrams and Entity-Relationship models

This case study serves as both documentation and a demonstration of the system's capabilities.

## Key Features

- **Multi-model persistence**: Store the same conceptual data in different database paradigms to unlock unique analytical capabilities
- **Causal graph traversal**: Follow the explicit links between actions and consequences
- **Semantic reasoning**: Apply formal logic to organizational knowledge
- **Quantified impact analysis**: Measure and visualize the precise effects of organizational decisions

## Getting Started

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/phantom-metal-taste.git

# Install dependencies
cd phantom-metal-taste
deno task build

# Start the databases (requires Podman)
podman-compose up -d

# Run the orchestrator
deno task dev
```

## The Deeper Question

This project asks a fundamental question: What happens when we apply the full rigor of enterprise architecture, formal modeling, and data science to measure the gap between institutional intent and lived reality?

The answer may leave a curious taste in your mouth.
