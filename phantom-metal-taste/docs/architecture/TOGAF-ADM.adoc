== Executive Summary

This document presents the complete TOGAF Architecture Development Method cycle
for the Synergy Matrix, an enterprise initiative aimed at the quantification,
measurement, and continuous improvement of organizational wellness through
rigorous architectural discipline. The Synergy Matrix applies formal gap analysis
to the inherently immeasurable domain of human collaboration, producing precise
numerical scores for phenomena that have historically resisted quantification for
good reason.

The architecture described herein follows all eight phases of the TOGAF ADM and
has been reviewed by the Synergy Architecture Review Board.

---

== Preliminary Phase: Architecture Capability

=== Establishing the Synergy Architecture Practice

The Preliminary Phase establishes the organizational context and capability
required to deliver the Synergy Matrix. This involves creating a dedicated
Architecture Practice with the mandate to measure that which was previously
considered unmeasurable.

==== Architecture Principles

[cols="2,4,4"]
|===
| Principle | Statement | Rationale

| Quantify Everything
| All organizational phenomena must be expressible as a numerical score.
| Unquantified phenomena cannot be placed on dashboards, and dashboards are
  the primary deliverable of this initiative.

| Semantic Precision
| Every concept in the wellness domain must be formally modeled in OWL/RDF.
| Informal understanding of human experience is insufficient for enterprise
  reporting requirements.

| Technology-Led Insight
| The technology stack determines what can be measured, and what can be measured
  determines what matters.
| This principle ensures alignment between architectural investment and
  organizational priorities.

| Perpetual Improvement
| No initiative is ever cancelled; it is rebranded and redeployed.
| Cancellation implies failure, which is incompatible with the wellness mandate.
|===

==== Architecture Repository

All architecture artifacts are maintained within the `phantom-metal-taste`
repository. The ontology definitions, data models, and deployment diagrams
referenced throughout this document are stored in `docs/diagrams/` and
`ontology/` respectively.

==== Tailored Architecture Framework

The standard TOGAF ADM has been tailored for the Synergy Matrix by adding
a ninth implicit phase: *Denial Management*, which runs concurrently with
all other phases and ensures that inconvenient findings are contextualized
appropriately before reaching executive stakeholders.

---

== Phase A: Architecture Vision

=== Problem Statement

Organizational wellness remains unquantified. Despite decades of employee
surveys, team retrospectives, and motivational posters, no enterprise has
successfully reduced the full spectrum of human collaborative experience to
a single numerical score. The Synergy Matrix addresses this gap -- or more
precisely, it addresses the gap between what leadership believes is happening
and what is actually happening, and then quantifies that gap as well.

=== Stakeholder Map

[cols="2,2,3,2"]
|===
| Stakeholder | Role | Concern | Influence

| Chad Kensington
| VP Human Synergy, Sponsor
| "Prove the Synergy Matrix works"
| Very High

| Brenda Smith
| Senior Engineer, Affected Party
| "Please stop measuring my mood"
| Low (officially) / High (informally)

| Robert Kim
| CFO, Budget Approver, Skeptic
| "Show me the ROI"
| High (ignored)

| Jennifer Harmon
| CEO, Executive Sponsor
| "Something about culture"
| Nominal
|===

NOTE: Stakeholder influence ratings were determined by Chad Kensington.
Brenda Smith's informal influence reflects the empirical observation that
engineers who object to measurement systems tend to be correct, a pattern
the architecture deliberately does not model.

=== Architecture Vision Statement

_"From unquantified positivity to precisely measured outcomes."_

The target state envisions an organization in which every wellness initiative,
team interaction, and collaborative endeavor is captured, scored, and tracked
through a formal gap analysis pipeline. The architecture enables leadership to
view real-time dashboards of organizational synergy, replacing the current
approach of asking people how they feel with the more rigorous approach of
telling them how they feel based on graph traversal algorithms.

=== Business Scenario

. Leadership launches a wellness initiative (e.g., "Mandatory Fun Fridays").
. The initiative is instrumented via the Synergy Matrix platform.
. Participation metrics, sentiment proxies, and collaboration graph density
  are collected and analyzed.
. A Synergy Gap Score is computed, revealing the delta between intended
  wellness outcomes and observed reality.
. The gap score is presented to Chad Kensington.
. Chad requests adjustments to the scoring algorithm.
. The adjusted score is presented to Jennifer Harmon.
. Jennifer nods approvingly. The initiative is declared successful.

---

== Phase B: Business Architecture

=== Capability Model

The Synergy Matrix requires the following enterprise capabilities:

[cols="2,3,2"]
|===
| Capability | Description | Maturity

| Synergy Quantification
| The core capability. Reduces complex human dynamics to decimal values
  with two places of precision.
| Target: Level 4 (Managed and Measurable). Current: Level 0 (Nonexistent,
  which is itself a data point).

| Initiative Lifecycle Management
| Manages the full lifecycle of wellness initiatives from conception through
  rebranding.
| Target: Level 3 (Defined)

| Gap Analysis Orchestration
| Coordinates multi-dimensional gap calculations across heterogeneous data
  sources.
| Target: Level 5 (Optimizing)

| Dashboard Proliferation
| Ensures that every metric, regardless of utility, is visualized in at
  least three distinct chart types.
| Target: Level 4 (Managed)
|===

=== Business Process: Initiative Lifecycle

The canonical business process for all wellness initiatives follows five
stages. The process is modeled as a linear flow, although in practice it
is better described as a spiral.

[source]
----
Plan --> Launch --> Monitor --> Discover Unintended Consequences --> Rebrand as Success
  ^                                                                        |
  |________________________________________________________________________|
          (repeat with new initiative name and identical objectives)
----

The "Discover Unintended Consequences" stage is architecturally significant
because it generates the majority of data consumed by the gap analysis
engine. The subsequent "Rebrand as Success" stage ensures that this data
is interpreted constructively.

=== Value Stream: Wellness Intent to Measurable Outcome

[cols="1,3,2"]
|===
| Stage | Activity | Value Contribution

| Ideation
| Chad conceives a new wellness initiative during an offsite.
| Generates executive enthusiasm.

| Definition
| The initiative is formalized with KPIs that sound rigorous.
| Creates the illusion of measurability.

| Instrumentation
| The Synergy Matrix platform is configured to capture relevant signals.
| Produces actual data, occasionally useful.

| Analysis
| Gap scores are computed across multiple dimensions.
| Reveals truths that require careful contextualization.

| Reporting
| Dashboard views are curated for stakeholder consumption.
| Converts complex findings into approved narratives.
|===

---

== Phase C: Information Systems Architecture

=== Data Architecture

The data architecture supports the capture, storage, and analysis of
wellness metrics at enterprise scale. The Entity-Relationship model is
documented in the following diagram:

* *E-R Diagram*: `docs/diagrams/er-diagram.puml`

==== Core Entities

[cols="2,3,2"]
|===
| Entity | Purpose | Storage

| Initiative
| A wellness program with defined objectives and a predetermined outcome.
| ArangoDB (document collection)

| Participant
| An employee subject to wellness measurement, with or without consent.
| ArangoDB (document collection)

| SynergyScore
| A composite numerical value representing wellness state. Decimal(10,2).
| ArangoDB (document collection)

| GapAnalysis
| The delta between target and actual synergy, computed with false precision.
| ArangoDB (document collection) + Julia analytics tier

| WellnessOntologyEntity
| A formal OWL class representing a wellness concept.
| Virtuoso (RDF triple store)
|===

==== Graph Relationships

ArangoDB edge collections model the following relationships:

* `PARTICIPATES_IN` -- links Participants to Initiatives
* `SCORED_BY` -- links Participants to SynergyScores
* `GAPS_IDENTIFIED` -- links GapAnalysis results to Initiatives
* `INFLUENCES` -- links Participants to other Participants (collaboration graph)
* `REPORTS_TO` -- organizational hierarchy (determines whose gaps are visible to whom)

=== Application Architecture

The application architecture follows a layered approach with clear
separation of concerns. Data flow diagrams are maintained at:

* *Context DFD*: `docs/diagrams/dfd-context.puml`
* *Detailed DFD*: `docs/diagrams/dfd-detailed.puml`

==== Application Components

[cols="2,2,3"]
|===
| Component | Technology | Responsibility

| Orchestration Layer
| ReScript / Deno
| Coordinates initiative lifecycle, manages API surface, and ensures
  that all requests pass through the appropriate authorization layer
  (i.e., Chad).

| Gap Engine
| Rust / WASM
| Performance-critical gap calculations. Computes synergy deltas at
  sub-millisecond latency, which is important because the results are
  viewed approximately once per quarter.

| Analytics Pipeline
| Julia
| Statistical analysis of wellness trends. Capable of sophisticated
  time-series decomposition of data that is fundamentally noise.

| Graph Service
| ArangoDB
| Traverses the organizational collaboration graph to identify synergy
  clusters and isolation patterns.

| Semantic Reasoner
| Virtuoso (OWL/RDF)
| Performs ontological inference over the wellness domain model,
  discovering relationships between concepts such as "Mandatory Fun"
  and "Decreased Retention."
|===

=== Ontology Architecture

The Synergy Matrix employs a formal OWL ontology hosted in Virtuoso to
model the wellness domain with semantic rigor. Key ontology classes:

* `syn:WellnessInitiative` -- superclass of all initiative types
* `syn:MandatoryParticipation` -- subclass indicating non-voluntary enrollment
* `syn:SynergyGap` -- quantified delta, with datatype property `syn:gapMagnitude`
* `syn:UnintendedConsequence` -- linked to initiatives via `syn:producedBy`
* `syn:Rebranding` -- transformation that maps failed initiatives to successful ones

SPARQL queries against this ontology power the semantic reasoning layer,
enabling the system to answer questions such as "Which initiatives caused
the most unintended consequences?" -- a query that has been disabled in
the production dashboard by request of the Sponsor.

---

== Phase D: Technology Architecture

=== Technology Stack

[cols="2,2,3"]
|===
| Layer | Technology | Justification

| Orchestration & API
| ReScript compiled via Deno runtime
| Type-safe orchestration without the overhead of TypeScript. ReScript
  compiles to clean JavaScript executed by Deno, ensuring reproducible
  builds and eliminating the npm supply chain as an attack vector.

| Performance-Critical Computation
| Rust compiled to WebAssembly
| Gap calculations require deterministic, high-performance execution.
  Rust/WASM ensures that synergy scores are computed with the kind of
  precision normally reserved for problems that actually need it.

| Statistical Analysis
| Julia
| Batch analytics and time-series decomposition. Julia's multiple
  dispatch model aligns well with the multi-dimensional nature of
  wellness data, and its performance profile supports analyses that
  would be impractical in interpreted languages.

| Graph Database
| ArangoDB
| Multi-model database supporting document, graph, and key-value access
  patterns. The collaboration graph requires efficient traversal for
  influence propagation and synergy cluster detection.

| Semantic Store
| Virtuoso (OpenLink)
| Enterprise-grade triple store for OWL/RDF. Supports SPARQL 1.1 with
  reasoning extensions required by the wellness ontology.

| Containerization
| Podman
| All services are containerized using Podman with Chainguard base
  images (`cgr.dev/chainguard/wolfi-base`). Container orchestration
  follows the `selur-compose` pattern.

| ABI/FFI
| Idris2 (ABI definitions) / Zig (FFI implementation)
| Cross-language interop between the Rust/WASM gap engine and the
  Julia analytics tier follows the universal ABI/FFI standard.
|===

=== Infrastructure

The deployment architecture is documented in `docs/diagrams/deployment-diagram.puml`.

==== Environment Topology

[cols="1,2,3"]
|===
| Environment | Purpose | Notes

| Development
| Local development and unit testing
| Podman pods on developer workstations. Gap scores are uncalibrated.

| Staging
| Integration testing and stakeholder preview
| Full stack deployment. Dashboard access restricted to Chad Kensington
  to prevent premature interpretation of results.

| Production
| Live wellness measurement
| High-availability deployment with automated failover. Uptime SLA of
  99.9%, which is more reliable than the data it processes.
|===

---

== Phase E: Opportunities and Solutions

=== Migration Approach: Incremental Synergy Realization

The Synergy Matrix will be delivered through an incremental approach that
allows the organization to experience the benefits of wellness quantification
gradually, thereby limiting the volume of objections raised at any single
point in time.

=== Key Initiatives

[cols="2,3,2"]
|===
| Initiative | Description | Priority

| Instrument Everything, Question Nothing
| Deploy comprehensive telemetry across all wellness touchpoints. The
  architecture captures participation metrics, sentiment proxies, and
  collaboration density without requiring explicit justification for
  each data point collected.
| Critical

| Ontology-Driven Insight
| Leverage the Virtuoso semantic store to discover non-obvious
  relationships in wellness data, such as the correlation between
  mandatory team-building events and increased use of PTO.
| High

| Real-Time Gap Visualization
| Deploy the Rust/WASM gap engine to provide sub-second dashboard
  updates, ensuring that leadership can observe synergy degradation
  as it happens rather than after the fact.
| Medium

| Predictive Synergy Modeling
| Apply Julia-based time-series forecasting to predict future gap
  scores, enabling preemptive rebranding of initiatives before they
  are formally evaluated.
| Strategic (Phase 2)
|===

---

== Phase F: Migration Planning

=== Migration Vision

_"From unquantified positivity to precisely measured futility."_

The migration delivers the Synergy Matrix in three phases, each building
upon the foundation of the previous phase and each progressively revealing
truths that the organization may not be prepared to receive.

=== Migration Phases

==== Phase 1: Foundation (Months 1-3)

[cols="1,3"]
|===
| Activity | Details

| ArangoDB Deployment
| Provision graph database cluster. Define document collections for
  Initiatives, Participants, and SynergyScores. Establish edge
  collections for organizational relationships.

| Virtuoso Provisioning
| Deploy Virtuoso triple store. Load initial wellness ontology
  (OWL/RDF). Configure SPARQL endpoints.

| Schema Migration
| Execute data model as defined in `docs/diagrams/er-diagram.puml`.
  Seed reference data including initiative categories and scoring
  rubrics approved by Chad Kensington.

| Container Infrastructure
| Establish Podman pod definitions and `selur-compose` orchestration
  for all database services. Base images pinned to Chainguard.
|===

==== Phase 2: Instrumentation (Months 4-6)

[cols="1,3"]
|===
| Activity | Details

| Orchestration Layer
| Deploy ReScript/Deno API services. Implement initiative lifecycle
  management and participant enrollment workflows.

| Metrics Collection
| Activate telemetry collection across wellness initiative touchpoints.
  Deploy event ingestion pipeline. Begin accumulating the data that will
  eventually be used to draw conclusions already decided upon.

| Gap Engine (Alpha)
| Deploy initial Rust/WASM gap calculation module. Calibrate scoring
  algorithm against historical initiative data, such as it exists.

| Graph Population
| Build collaboration graph from organizational data sources.
  Compute initial influence propagation scores.
|===

==== Phase 3: Enlightenment (Months 7-9)

[cols="1,3"]
|===
| Activity | Details

| Full Gap Analysis
| Activate comprehensive gap analysis across all active initiatives.
  The system begins producing scores that accurately reflect the delta
  between wellness aspirations and organizational reality.

| Julia Analytics
| Deploy statistical analysis pipeline. Time-series decomposition
  reveals trends that are simultaneously obvious and unwelcome.

| Semantic Reasoning
| Enable ontological inference in Virtuoso. The reasoner discovers
  that "Mandatory Fun" and "Voluntary Attrition" share a statistically
  significant co-occurrence pattern.

| Dashboard Launch
| Production dashboards made available to all authorized stakeholders.
  Authorization criteria managed by Chad Kensington.
|===

=== Risk Register

[cols="1,3,2,2"]
|===
| ID | Risk | Likelihood | Mitigation

| R-001
| The system may reveal that the Synergy Matrix itself has the highest
  gap score of any initiative in the organization.
| High
| Exclude the Synergy Matrix from its own analysis. If questioned,
  cite "reflexivity concerns."

| R-002
| Engineers subject to wellness measurement may exhibit decreased
  wellness as a direct result of being measured.
| Very High
| Classify this as a "calibration artifact" rather than a finding.

| R-003
| The CFO may request a cost-benefit analysis comparing the Synergy
  Matrix budget to the cost of simply asking employees how they feel.
| Medium
| Preemptively reframe the comparison as "qualitative vs. quantitative
  maturity" and reference Phase E, Initiative 1.

| R-004
| The ontology reasoner may infer relationships that are politically
  inconvenient.
| Certain
| Implement query-level access controls in Virtuoso. Certain SPARQL
  patterns require Sponsor approval before execution.
|===

---

== Phase G: Implementation Governance

=== Synergy Architecture Review Board (SARB)

The Synergy Architecture Review Board provides governance oversight for
all architectural decisions related to the Synergy Matrix.

[cols="2,2,2"]
|===
| Member | Role | Voting Rights

| Chad Kensington (Chair)
| VP Human Synergy
| Full voting, plus tie-breaking authority, plus veto

| Brenda Smith
| Engineering Representative
| Advisory (non-binding)

| Robert Kim
| Finance Representative
| Voting (overridden by Chair veto as needed)

| Rotating Seat
| Architecture Practice
| Voting (has never voted against the Chair)
|===

The Board meets bi-weekly on Thursday afternoons. Meeting minutes are
recorded and stored in the architecture repository. To date, the Board has
reviewed forty-seven proposals and has never rejected a proposal submitted
by the Chair. Proposals submitted by other members have a 23% approval rate.

=== Compliance Checkpoints

[cols="1,3,2"]
|===
| Checkpoint | Criteria | Frequency

| CP-1: Architecture Conformance
| All deployed components conform to the technology architecture
  defined in Phase D. Deviations require SARB approval.
| Monthly

| CP-2: Data Model Integrity
| Database schemas match the approved E-R diagram. No unauthorized
  entities or relationships have been introduced.
| Bi-weekly

| CP-3: Ontology Consistency
| OWL ontology passes consistency checking. No contradictions exist
  in the wellness domain model (contradictions in the actual wellness
  data are out of scope).
| Monthly

| CP-4: Dashboard Accuracy
| Dashboard visualizations accurately reflect computed scores. The
  accuracy of the underlying scores relative to reality is outside
  the scope of this checkpoint.
| Weekly

| CP-5: Initiative Lifecycle
| All active initiatives are progressing through the defined lifecycle
  stages. Initiatives in the "Discover Unintended Consequences" stage
  for longer than sixty days are automatically advanced to "Rebrand
  as Success."
| Quarterly
|===

=== Architecture Decision Records

All significant architectural decisions are recorded as ADRs in the
repository. Key decisions include:

* *ADR-001*: Adoption of ArangoDB over Neo4j for graph storage
* *ADR-002*: Selection of Rust/WASM for gap calculations
* *ADR-003*: Use of OWL/RDF for wellness ontology (rather than informal definitions)
* *ADR-004*: Decision to exclude the Synergy Matrix from its own gap analysis
* *ADR-005*: Removal of the "Cancel Initiative" button from the dashboard UI

ADRs are stored in `.machine_readable/META.scm` under the
`architecture-decisions` section and follow the standard ADR format
(Context, Decision, Status, Consequences).

---

== Phase H: Architecture Change Management

=== Change Management Principles

The Synergy Matrix architecture must evolve in response to changing
organizational needs while maintaining the core invariant that no
initiative is ever declared a failure. The change management process
ensures that architectural evolution serves the dual mandate of
technical excellence and narrative continuity.

=== Change Triggers

[cols="2,3"]
|===
| Trigger | Response

| Initiative produces unexpected negative outcomes
| The initiative is rebranded. The architecture is updated to
  support the new initiative name while preserving all historical
  data under the original name (accessible only to SARB members).

| Gap scores consistently indicate no improvement
| The scoring algorithm is recalibrated. If recalibration is
  insufficient, the definition of "improvement" is revised.

| New wellness initiative proposed by Chad
| Architecture is extended to accommodate the initiative. No
  feasibility assessment is required for Sponsor-originated requests.

| Engineer raises concern about measurement methodology
| Concern is logged in the architecture repository as a "future
  consideration." No timeline is assigned.

| CFO requests budget justification
| A new dashboard is created showing the correlation between Synergy
  Matrix investment and a carefully selected subset of organizational
  metrics that happen to trend favorably.
|===

=== Change Request Process

All architecture change requests follow the standard process:

. Change request submitted via the architecture repository.
. If submitted by Chad Kensington: approved automatically, proceed to
  implementation.
. If submitted by any other stakeholder: routed to Chad Kensington for
  review.
.. If Chad approves: proceed to implementation.
.. If Chad does not approve: request is tabled for "future consideration"
   and added to the backlog, which is reviewed annually.
. Implementation follows the governance checkpoints defined in Phase G.
. Post-implementation review conducted by SARB (see Phase G for Board
  composition and voting dynamics).

=== Architecture Evolution Roadmap

[cols="1,2,3"]
|===
| Horizon | Timeframe | Capability

| Horizon 1
| Current - 6 months
| Foundational gap analysis and dashboard delivery. The organization
  learns what its synergy scores are, even if it would prefer not to.

| Horizon 2
| 6 - 18 months
| Predictive modeling and automated rebranding. The system anticipates
  initiative failure and prepares rebrand proposals before human
  stakeholders are aware of the need.

| Horizon 3
| 18 - 36 months
| Autonomous Synergy Management. The Synergy Matrix creates, monitors,
  evaluates, and rebrands initiatives without human intervention,
  achieving the architectural ideal of a fully closed-loop wellness
  system that requires no actual wellness.

=== Appendix B: Glossary

[cols="2,4"]
|===
| Term | Definition

| Synergy Gap
| The quantified delta between the intended outcome of a wellness
  initiative and its observed impact. Always expressed as a positive
  number, because negative gaps would imply that an initiative exceeded
  expectations, which has not yet been observed.

| Rebranding
| The architectural pattern by which a failed initiative is transformed
  into a successful one through the application of a new name, revised
  KPIs, and selective historical data presentation.

| Calibration Artifact
| Any measurement result that contradicts the expected narrative. Treated
  as a systematic error in the instrumentation rather than a valid finding.

| Reflexivity Concern
| The theoretical problem arising when the Synergy Matrix attempts to
  measure itself. Resolved architecturally by excluding the system from
  its own analysis (see ADR-004).

| Sponsor-Originated Request
| A change request submitted by Chad Kensington, which follows an
  expedited approval process consisting of no approval process.
