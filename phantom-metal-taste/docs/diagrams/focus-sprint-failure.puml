title Focus-Sprint Protocol: Intended Path vs. Reality

actor "Chad Kensington\n(VP Human Synergy)" as Chad #E8EAF6
participant "Synergy Matrix\nSystem" as System #C8E6C9
participant "Slack/Teams\n(Disabled)" as Chat #FFCDD2
actor "Brenda Smith\n(Senior Engineer)" as Brenda #FFF9C4
participant "Production\nServer" as Server #FFCCBC
participant "Personal\nPhones" as Phones #FFE0B2
participant "Incident\nResponse" as IR #EF9A9A

== INTENDED PATH: "Deep Work Through Digital Minimalism" ==

Chad -> System : Activate Focus-Sprint Protocol
System -> Chat : Disable all chat channels\n(4-hour blackout window)
Chat --> Brenda : [Connection severed]
note right of Brenda
    **Intended:**
    Brenda enters state of
    deep, uninterrupted flow.
    Productivity increases 300%.
    Chad's TED talk writes itself.
end note

== WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENS (17 minutes in) ==

Server -> Server : **CRITICAL: OOM killer\ntriggers on prod-db-03**
Server -[#F44336]-> IR : PagerDuty alert fires
IR -[#F44336]-> Brenda : Page: P0 incident\n(SMS bypasses blackout)

Brenda -> Chat : Attempt to coordinate\nincident response
Chat -[#F44336]x Brenda : **BLOCKED**\n"Focus-Sprint active.\nDeep work in progress."
note right of Brenda #FFCDD2
    Chat is disabled.
    The incident channel
    is unreachable.
    The runbook is pinned
    in the incident channel.
end note

Brenda -> Phones : Create iMessage group:\n"prod is on fire"
note right of Phones #FFE0B2
    **Security violation:**
    Production credentials
    shared over unencrypted
    personal messaging.

    InfoSec will have opinions
    about this later.
end note

Phones -> Phones : 6 engineers coordinate\nvia personal devices
Brenda -> Server : SSH directly to prod\n(bypasses bastion host)
note right of Brenda
    **Additional security violation.**
    The bastion host auth
    requires Slack OAuth.
    Slack is disabled.
end note

Server --> Brenda : Incident resolved\n(43 minutes, normal: 15)

== AFTERMATH ==

Brenda -> System : Submit post-incident report\n"Chat blackout tripled\nresolution time"
System -> System : Log anomalous outcome:\n"Focus-Sprint Protocol\ncaused security violations\nand extended P0 by 28min"

Chad -> System : Query: "How did\nFocus-Sprint go?"
System -> Chad : **Gap Score: 94/100**\nIntended: deep work\nActual: chaos, security\nviolations, extended outage

Chad -> Chad : <<internal processing>>
note right of Chad #E8EAF6
    Chad decides the incident
    was "an edge case" and
    the protocol is "fundamentally
    sound." He will present it
    at next month's all-hands
    as a "successful innovation
    in digital wellness."
end note

Chad -> System : Override: Mark Focus-Sprint\nas "Successful with\nminor learnings"
System -> System : Log: gap between\nreported status and\nactual outcome = **maximum**

Brenda -> System : Mood self-report: **8**
note right of Brenda #FFF9C4
    **Strategic dishonesty.**
    Actual mood: 2.
    Brenda has learned that
    low mood scores trigger
    "wellness check-ins" from
    Chad, which take 45 minutes
    and accomplish nothing.

    Reporting 8 is self-defense.
end note

System -> System : Record:\nFocus-Sprint satisfaction = 8/10\n(Sample size: 1 honest response\nout of 47 submitted)
