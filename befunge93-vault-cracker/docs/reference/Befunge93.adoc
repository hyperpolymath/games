== What is Befunge-93?

**Befunge-93** is an esoteric programming language created by Chris Pressey in 1993. It was designed to be as difficult to compile as possible.

== Key Characteristics

=== 2D Execution

Unlike traditional languages where code executes line by line, Befunge executes on a 2D grid. The program counter (PC) can move in four directions:

----
    ^
    |
<-- PC -->
    |
    v
----

Direction commands:
- `>` - Move right
- `<` - Move left
- `^` - Move up
- `v` - Move down

=== The Playfield

The playfield is exactly 80 columns by 25 rows (classic terminal dimensions). Code wraps around edges.

+------------------80 columns------------------+
|                                              |
|    v < Your code lives here > ^              |
|                                              |
25 rows                                        |
|                                              |
+----------------------------------------------+
----

=== Stack-Based

All operations work on a LIFO (Last In, First Out) stack:

----
Push 3:     [] -> [3]
Push 5:     [3] -> [3, 5]
Add:        [3, 5] -> [8]
----

=== Self-Modifying

The `p` (put) command can modify the playfield during execution. This makes Befunge extremely difficult to compile ahead of time.

== Instruction Set

=== Arithmetic

[cols="1,3"]
|===
| Instruction | Description

| `+` | Pop a and b, push a+b
| `-` | Pop a and b, push b-a
| `*` | Pop a and b, push a*b
| `/` | Pop a and b, push b/a (integer division)
| `%` | Pop a and b, push b%a (modulo)
|===

=== Stack Manipulation

[cols="1,3"]
|===
| Instruction | Description

| `0-9` | Push digit (0-9) onto stack
| `:` | Duplicate top of stack
| `\` | Swap top two values
| `$` | Pop and discard top value
|===

=== I/O

[cols="1,3"]
|===
| Instruction | Description

| `.` | Pop and output as integer
| `,` | Pop and output as ASCII character
| `&` | Read integer from input
| `~` | Read character from input
|===

=== Control Flow

[cols="1,3"]
|===
| Instruction | Description

| `>` | Move right
| `<` | Move left
| `^` | Move up
| `v` | Move down
| `?` | Move in random direction
| `_` | Pop; if zero, go right; else go left
| `\|` | Pop; if zero, go down; else go up
| `#` | Skip next cell (trampoline)
| `@` | End program
|===

=== Self-Modification

[cols="1,3"]
|===
| Instruction | Description

| `g` | Pop y and x, push value at (x,y)
| `p` | Pop y, x, and v; write v at (x,y)
|===

== Example: Hello World

[source]
----
>              v
v  ,,,,,"Hello"<
>48telerator*,v
v,,,,,,"World!"<
>25telerator*,@
----

== Why Use Befunge-93 in This Project?

This project uses Befunge-93 **purely as a satirical element**. The decorative "Befunge underpinning" ASCII art represents the absurdity of claiming a 1993 esoteric language could defeat modern cryptography.

No actual Befunge code is interpreted or executed.
