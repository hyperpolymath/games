== Overview

Befunge-93 Vault Cracker is a **parody application** that simulates an imaginary "attack" on an overengineered cryptographic vault using the power of https://esolangs.org/wiki/Befunge[Befunge-93], an esoteric programming language from 1993 that executes on a 2D grid.

The joke is simple: *no amount of modern cryptography can withstand the raw power of 1993 innovation.*

=== What This Is

* A **satirical UI** mocking both:
** Overengineered security solutions (Ed448, SHAKE3-256, BLAKE3, Kyber-1024, Argon2id, MFA)
** The absurdity of esoteric programming languages
* A **TEA (The Elm Architecture) demonstration** in JavaScript/React
* A **CSS-first, dependency-free** single-file component
* Built for **screenshots and laughs**, not actual security research

=== What This Is NOT

* An actual vault cracker (no real cryptography is harmed)
* A Befunge-93 interpreter (the code is purely decorative)
* Security research or hacking tool
* A serious application

== Quick Start

[source,bash]
----
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/hyperpolymath/befunge93-vault-cracker
cd befunge93-vault-cracker

# Serve locally (no build step needed - pure JS)
just serve

# Open in browser
open http://localhost:8000
----

== Screenshots

The UI features:

* **Vault Stack Panel** - Shows six "security layers" being "melted" one by one
* **Attack Console** - A scrolling log of absurd technical babble
* **Befunge-93 Underpinning** - Decorative ASCII art grid
* **Telemetry Panel** - Fake metrics (Entropy, Latency, Vibes)

== Architecture

=== Technology Stack

[cols="1,2"]
|===
| Component | Technology

| Language | JavaScript (JSX)
| UI Framework | React
| State Management | TEA pattern (Model-Update-View)
| Styling | Inline CSS (CSS-first, no dependencies)
| Runtime | Deno (for development server)

NOTE: The source file uses a `.res` extension but contains standard JavaScript/JSX. This is intentional parody nomenclature.

=== The "Vault Stack"

The fictional vault being "cracked" consists of:

[cols="1,1,3"]
|===
| Layer | Algorithm | Satirical Description

| [S] | Ed448 Signatures | "Elliptic curve gravitas"
| [K] | SHAKE3-256 Sponge | "Absorb fear, squeeze certainty"
| [H] | BLAKE3 Hyperhash | "Parallel reassurance, artisanal entropy"
| [Q] | Kyber-1024 | "Post quantum-ish lattice whispering"
| [P] | Argon2id KDF | "Memory hard, time soft, vibe strong"
| [2] | MFA + Vault | "Two factors enter, one factor leaves"
|===

=== The "Attack"

The Befunge-93 "attack" produces absurd log messages like:

* "Injecting BEFUNGE-93 UNDERPINNING..."
* "Reversing control flow with 2D stack topology..."
* "Collapsing MFA into a single factor of irony..."
* "Attempting to typecheck the universe (failed; continue)..."

== Development

=== Prerequisites

* https://deno.land/[Deno] runtime
* https://github.com/casey/just[just] command runner

=== Build Commands

[source,bash]
----
just serve     # Start development server
just check     # Run all checks
----

=== JavaScript Configuration

The project uses vanilla JavaScript with:

* React via CDN (no npm/node dependencies)
* ES6 modules
* Inline CSS (no external stylesheets)
* TEA pattern for state management

== About Befunge-93

https://esolangs.org/wiki/Befunge[Befunge-93] is an esoteric programming language created by Chris Pressey in 1993. Key features:

* **2D execution**: The program counter moves on a 2D grid, changing direction with `<>^v` commands
* **Self-modifying**: Programs can modify their own source code
* **Stack-based**: All operations work on a LIFO stack
* **80x25 playfield**: Classic terminal dimensions

This project uses Befunge-93 purely as a satirical element. No actual Befunge code is executed.

== FAQ

=== Is this a real security tool?

No. This is purely satirical. No cryptography is actually implemented or attacked.

=== Why Befunge-93?

Because the absurdity of a 1993 esoteric 2D language "defeating" modern post-quantum cryptography is inherently funny.

=== Can I use this for presentations?

Yes! This was designed to be screenshot-friendly and visually entertaining for talks about:

* Overengineered security solutions
* Esoteric programming languages
* The absurdity of "security theater"
* TEA architecture in JavaScript/React
