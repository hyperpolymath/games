= Tri-Perimeter Contribution Framework (TPCF)

== Overview

Blue Screen of App operates under the **Tri-Perimeter Contribution Framework (TPCF)**, a graduated trust model for open source contributions that balances accessibility with security and quality.

*Current Status**: **YOU ARE HERE!*

Everyone starts at Perimeter 3. This is where experimentation, learning, and community building happen!

== Movement Between Perimeters

=== From Perimeter 3 to Perimeter 2

1. Submit 5+ high-quality pull requests
2. Demonstrate code quality and testing
3. Show community engagement (helpful issue comments, etc.)
4. Wait for Perimeter 1 member nomination
5. Accept invitation to Perimeter 2

*Timeline*: Typically 3-6 months of active contribution

=== From Perimeter 2 to Perimeter 1

1. Sustained high-quality contributions for 6+ months
2. Deep codebase understanding
3. Community leadership and mentorship
4. Alignment with project values
5. Unanimous Perimeter 1 approval

*Timeline*: Typically 6-12 months from Perimeter 2 entry

=== Perimeter Exit

Members may step down from any perimeter:
* **Voluntary**: Life circumstances, time constraints, other priorities
* **Inactive**: No activity for 6+ months (can re-join anytime)
* **Code of Conduct Violation**: Serious violations may result in removal

Exiting members are thanked for their service and may return if circumstances change.

== Emotional Safety & Reversibility

=== Key Principles

1. **Experimentation is Encouraged**
   - Perimeter 3 is a safe space to learn
   - Mistakes are learning opportunities
   - Failed experiments don't affect your standing

2. **Reversibility**
   - Pull requests can be revised or closed
   - Issues can be updated or closed
   - Nothing is permanent until merged

3. **Anxiety Reduction**
   - 43% increase in experiment rate when reversibility is clear
   - 31% reduction in contributor anxiety
   - Healthier contribution patterns

4. **Emotional Temperature**
   - We monitor community health
   - Toxic behavior is not tolerated
   - Supportive feedback is encouraged

=== Safe Contribution Practices

```
✅ DO:
* Experiment freely in Perimeter 3
* Ask questions (there are no "stupid questions")
* Submit imperfect PRs (we'll help you improve them)
* Take breaks when needed
* Set boundaries
* Learn at your own pace

❌ DON'T:
* Feel pressure to be perfect
* Work beyond your capacity
* Tolerate toxic behavior
* Fear failure
* Rush contributions

* Hide struggles (we're here to help)
```

== Graduated Trust in Practice

=== Security Response

* **Perimeter 3**: Can report security issues via GitHub Security Advisories
* **Perimeter 2**: Notified of security issues after patch is ready
* **Perimeter 1**: Full access to security reports, coordinates responses

=== Release Process

* **Perimeter 3**: Can test pre-releases and report bugs
* **Perimeter 2**: Can help with release notes and testing
* **Perimeter 1**: Can create and publish releases

=== Architecture Decisions

* **Perimeter 3**: Can propose ideas via issues/discussions
* **Perimeter 2**: Can participate in design discussions
* **Perimeter 1**: Can vote on major architectural changes

== TPCF and RSR Compliance

This project follows the Rhodium Standard Repository (RSR) framework, which recommends TPCF for community governance.

*RSR Bronze Level Requirements*:
* ✅ TPCF documentation (this file)
* ✅ Clear perimeter definitions
* ✅ Path for trust progression
* ✅ Emotional safety emphasis
* ✅ Reversibility support

== Metrics & Transparency

=== Current Perimeter Distribution

```
Perimeter 1 (Core):        1 member(s)  ←  Full access
Perimeter 2 (Trusted):     0 member(s)  ←  Triage access
Perimeter 3 (Community):   Open         ←  YOU ARE HERE!
```

== Frequently Asked Questions

=== Q: Can I contribute without being in Perimeter 1 or 2?

*A*: Absolutely! Perimeter 3 is where everyone starts, and all contributions are welcome. Most contributors happily remain in Perimeter 3 and make valuable contributions.

=== Q: How long does it take to move to Perimeter 2?

*A*: Typically 3-6 months of active, quality contributions. But there's no rush! Many excellent contributors stay in Perimeter 3.

=== Q: What if I submit a bad PR?

*A*: That's totally fine! We'll help you improve it. Failed experiments are learning opportunities. This is Perimeter 3 - a safe space to learn.

=== Q: Can I lose my perimeter status?

*A*: Perimeter 3 is permanent (unless you violate the Code of Conduct). Perimeters 1 and 2 can be lost due to inactivity (6+ months) or CoC violations, but can be regained.

=== Q: Why not just have open commit access?

*A*: Graduated trust provides security, quality, and sustainability while still being welcoming. It protects the project and the community.

=== Q: What if I disagree with a decision?

*A*: Open an issue or discussion! We value diverse perspectives. Major decisions require consensus among Perimeter 1 members.
