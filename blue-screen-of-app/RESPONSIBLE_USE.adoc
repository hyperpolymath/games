= Responsible Use Guidelines

== The Dual-Use Problem

Blue Screen of App is **dual-use technology**: it can be used for both beneficial and harmful purposes.

=== Intended (Beneficial) Uses

* 😄 **Humor/Entertainment** - Harmless pranks among friends
* 📚 **Education** - Teaching about error messages and UI design
* 🎬 **Content Creation** - Screenshots for presentations, videos, documentation
* 🧪 **Testing/Demos** - UI/UX demonstrations, developer tools
* 💡 **Developer Culture** - Jokes about common coding frustrations

=== Potential Harmful Uses

* 🎣 **Social Engineering** - Making users believe their system crashed
* 📞 **Tech Support Scams** - "Call this number to fix your computer"
* 🔗 **Phishing** - Fake BSOD leading to credential harvesting pages
* 😰 **Psychological Manipulation** - Creating panic to extract information/money
* 🚫 **Harassment** - Deliberately causing distress to non-technical users

== The Problem of Unintended Consequences

**We cannot predict all future harms.**

Your chain of reasoning:
----
1. Someone installs BSOD prank on friend's phone
2. Friend panics, gets angry
3. Friend throws phone, breaking it
4. Phone kills stray dog
----

This is theoretically possible. **Every technology has infinite potential chains of causation.**

=== Historical Examples

* **Dynamite** - Nobel invented for mining → used in warfare
* **Social Media** - Connection tool → radicalization pipeline
* **Facial Recognition** - Unlock phones → surveillance state
* **Kitchen Knives** - Cook dinner → murder weapons

**Where do we draw the line?**

== Our Ethical Framework

=== 1. Proximity of Harm

We accept responsibility based on how **foreseeable** the harm is:

* ✅ **Highly foreseeable**: BSOD used for tech support scams
  - **Our responsibility**: Document this risk, add warnings
* ⚠️ **Somewhat foreseeable**: User gets angry, damages property
  - **Shared responsibility**: We warn about pranks, user chooses targets
* ❌ **Unforeseeable**: Multi-step chains leading to unpredictable outcomes
  - **Not our responsibility**: Cannot control all possible futures

=== 2. Primary Design Intent

* **Not designed for harm** - Primary purpose is humor/education
* **Requires modification for weaponization** - Must add deception, modify UI
* **Transparent implementation** - Open source, clearly documented as joke
* **Harm signals included** - Humorous error messages make scam use less effective

=== 3. Reasonable Mitigations

What we've done to reduce harm:

* ✅ **Obvious humor signals** - `COFFEE_NOT_FOUND`, `NPM_INSTALL_TIMEOUT`
* ✅ **No system access** - Purely visual, doesn't touch actual OS
* ✅ **Transparent code** - Open source, auditable
* ✅ **Clear documentation** - Explicitly labeled as humor tool
* ✅ **Educational framing** - RSR/TPCF compliance, security practices
* ✅ **Responsible disclosure** - RFC 9116 security.txt

== Known Risks & Warnings

=== ⚠️ Tech Support Scams

**Risk**: Scammers could use this BSOD UI to convince users their computer is broken.

**Mitigation**:
* Humorous error messages make it obviously fake to alert users
* No phone numbers or "call now" messaging in our code
* Educational value teaches people to recognize fake errors

**Warning**: Do not modify this to remove humor signals for deceptive purposes.

=== ⚠️ Psychological Distress

**Risk**: Non-technical users may genuinely panic when seeing a BSOD.

**Mitigation**:
* Clear disclaimer that this is humor/prank software
* Documentation emphasizes consent and appropriate contexts

**Warning**: Do not use this on people who:
* Have anxiety disorders
* Are non-technical and might genuinely panic
* Are in high-stress situations (exams, job interviews, emergencies)
* Did not consent to being pranked

=== ⚠️ Professional Contexts

**Risk**: Using this in professional/workplace settings could have consequences.

**Warning**: Do not use this:
* On employer-owned devices without permission
* In critical business meetings or presentations
* On shared/public computers
* In contexts where it could be mistaken for actual system failure

== What We Cannot Control

**We acknowledge:**

1. **Future modifications** - Someone could fork this and remove humor signals
2. **Unforeseeable chains** - Infinite possible consequences we cannot predict
3. **Cultural differences** - What's funny in one context may be harmful in another
4. **Individual reactions** - Cannot control how each person responds

**We accept** that perfect safety is impossible and that creating nothing also causes harm (no tools, no innovation, no progress).

== Legal Disclaimer

This software is provided "AS IS" without warranty of any kind.

**You are responsible** for:
* How you use this software
* Ensuring you have consent from targets of pranks
* Complying with local laws regarding computer access/fraud
* Any consequences of misuse

**We are not responsible** for:
* Unauthorized modifications to this software
* Uses that violate this responsible use policy
* Distant or unforeseeable consequences
* Harm caused by ignoring these warnings

== Reporting Misuse

If you discover this software being used for:
* Tech support scams
* Phishing campaigns
* Harassment
* Other malicious purposes

Please report to: security@[repository-owner-domain]

Or file an issue: https://github.com/Hyperpolymath/blue-screen-of-app/issues

== The Honest Truth

**We don't know all the ways this might be misused.**

We're releasing this because:
* Primary intent is benign (humor/education)
* Foreseeable benefits outweigh foreseeable harms
* We've taken reasonable precautions
* Perfect safety is impossible
* The alternative (creating nothing) also causes harm

**But we acknowledge:**
* Uncertainty about future uses
* Limitations of our foresight
* Discomfort with potential misuse
* Ongoing responsibility to monitor and respond

== Conclusion

**Use responsibly.**

This is humor software, not a weapon. If you're modifying it to be deceptive, removing humor signals, or using it to cause genuine distress - you're the problem, not the software.

**The technology is neutral. Your choices are not.**
