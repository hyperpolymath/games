== Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by our Code of Conduct. By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to the project maintainers.

== How Can I Contribute?

=== Reporting Bugs

Before creating bug reports, please check the existing issues to avoid duplicates. When you create a bug report, include as many details as possible:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title**
* **Describe the exact steps to reproduce the problem**
* **Provide specific examples** to demonstrate the steps
* **Describe the behavior you observed** and what you expected
* **Include screenshots** if applicable
* **Include your environment details** (OS, Node version, browser, etc.)

=== Suggesting Enhancements

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as GitHub issues. When creating an enhancement suggestion, include:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title**
* **Provide a detailed description** of the suggested enhancement
* **Explain why this enhancement would be useful**
* **List any similar features** in other projects if applicable

=== Adding New Error Messages

We love creative and humorous error messages! To add new ones:

1. Edit `src/utils/errorMessages.js`
2. Add your error code to the `stopCodes` array
3. Add a description to the `descriptions` object
4. Make sure it's funny but not offensive
5. Test it works with `?code=YOUR_NEW_CODE`

Example:
```javascript
stopCodes: [
  // ... existing codes
  'YOUR_NEW_ERROR_CODE',
],

descriptions: {
  // ... existing descriptions
  'YOUR_NEW_ERROR_CODE': 'A witty description of your error.',
},
```

=== Adding New BSOD Styles

Want to add a macOS kernel panic or Linux panic screen?

1. Create a new EJS template in `src/views/` (e.g., `bsod-macos.ejs`)
2. Style it to match the target OS error screen
3. Add the style to the styles array in `src/routes/api.js`
4. Update documentation in README.md and API.md
5. Add tests in `tests/integration/bsod.test.js`

=== Pull Requests

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation
4. Ensure the test suite passes
5. Make sure your code lints
6. Issue that pull request!

==== Pull Request Guidelines

* **Keep PRs focused** - One feature/fix per PR
* **Write clear commit messages** - Use conventional commits format
* **Update documentation** - Keep README.md and API.md in sync
* **Add tests** - Maintain or improve code coverage
* **Follow the code style** - Run `npm run lint:fix`

==== Commit Message Format

We use conventional commits:

```
type(scope): subject

body

footer
```

Types:
* `feat`: New feature
* `fix`: Bug fix
* `docs`: Documentation changes
* `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
* `refactor`: Code refactoring
* `test`: Adding or updating tests
* `chore`: Maintenance tasks

Examples:
```

```

== Code Style

We use ESLint for code style enforcement:

* Use 2 spaces for indentation
* Use single quotes for strings
* Add trailing commas in multi-line objects/arrays
* Use semicolons
* Maximum line length: 100 characters
* Use `const` over `let` when possible
* Use arrow functions for callbacks

Example:
```javascript
const myFunction = (param1, param2) => {
  const result = {
    foo: 'bar',
    baz: 'qux',
  };

  return result;
};
```

== Testing Guidelines

* Write tests for all new features
* Maintain or improve code coverage
* Use descriptive test names
* Group related tests with `describe` blocks
* Use `beforeEach` for test setup when needed

Example:
```javascript
describe('Error Messages Utility', () => {
  describe('getRandomError', () => {
    test('should return a valid error object', () => {
      const error = getRandomError();
      expect(error).toHaveProperty('stopCode');
    });
  });
});
```

== Documentation

* Update README.md for user-facing changes
* Update API.md for API changes
* Add JSDoc comments for functions
* Update CLAUDE.md for architecture changes

== Adding Dependencies

Think carefully before adding new dependencies:

* Is it really needed?
* Is it well-maintained?
* What's the bundle size impact?
* Are there lighter alternatives?

Document why you're adding it in your PR description.

== Performance Considerations

* Keep bundle size small
* Optimize images and assets
* Use compression where appropriate
* Consider caching strategies
* Profile before optimizing

== Security

* Never commit secrets or credentials
* Sanitize all user inputs
* Keep dependencies updated
* Follow OWASP best practices
* Report security issues privately

== Questions?

Feel free to:
* Open an issue for discussion
* Reach out to maintainers
* Check existing issues and PRs

== Recognition

Contributors will be recognized in:
* GitHub contributors page
* Release notes for significant contributions
* Special mentions for creative error messages!

== License

By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under the MIT License.
