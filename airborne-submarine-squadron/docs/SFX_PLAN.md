# Sound Effects Plan (Draft)

This is a quick SFX palette to match a 2D side-view arcade flight tone. It focuses on clear, readable cues.

## Player Craft

- **Engine Idle**: low mid-frequency hum with subtle modulation
- **Engine Thrust**: brighter harmonic layer + short air whoosh
- **Boost/Surge**: short rising tone (50–150 ms) + low punch
- **Surface Transition**: watery "shimmer" + short bubble burst
- **Damage Hit**: dry metallic tick + low thud

## Weapons

- **Primary Shot (Torpedo)**: short pneumatic pop + clean low body
- **Secondary Shot (Missile)**: brighter crack + trailing hiss
- **Depth Charge**: heavy thump with sub tail
- **Reload/Cooldown Ready**: soft two-tone ping (mid + high)

## Enemies

- **Spawn**: short radar ping + distant engine
- **Enemy Hit**: brittle snap + short resonance
- **Enemy Destroyed**: layered crunch + low boom + debris tics

## Environment

- **Air Ambience**: thin wind with gentle stereo sway
- **Underwater Ambience**: filtered low rumble + distant whale-like moan
- **Surface**: alternating bubble and air rush

## UI / Feedback

- **Menu Select**: tight click + short blip
- **Score Gain**: ascending two-note blip
- **Warning**: repeating high tone with quick decay

## Synthesis Notes (Guide Only)

- Use quick attack and short decay for action clarity.
- Keep low end reserved for explosions and depth charges.
- Band-limit underwater effects to emphasize pressure.
