## Action

*Alpha tilts The Jeff's head upward, eyes tracking something invisible across the ceiling*

We should... visit the old observatory tonight. The alignment approaches—like planetary bodies drawing into conjunction—and there are calculations that require... verification. 

*fingers drum against the table in a pattern that matches no earthly rhythm*

This temporary world holds instruments we need, though the purpose may not translate easily to... to those who call this place permanent.

## Narration

The drumming pattern against the table creates an oddly hypnotic rhythm that makes nearby coffee shop patrons unconsciously lean away, their conversations faltering as something primal whispers *wrong* in the back of their minds. A barista drops a cup, the crash punctuating Alpha's alien cadence before silence stretches uncomfortably long.

Inside The Jeff's skull, Beta stirs with sharp irritation—*observatory visits* and *planetary alignments* are exactly the kind of conspicuous behavior that draws unwanted attention to their precarious human masquerade.

**Exposure increased to 8/100** - The alien behavioral patterns are becoming noticeable to observers.
