## Action

*I flex The Jeff's fingers, feeling the strange weight of flesh and bone as I wrestle control from Beta*

"This place... it grows heavier each rotation around its star." *I move toward the window, drawn to the night sky visible through the glass* "The patterns up there—they're calling, like gravitational pulls we cannot ignore. We need to find the old observatory... the one where humans once tried to pierce the void."

*I pause, touching the glass with fingertips that still feel foreign* "Beta doesn't understand—this vessel is temporary, but what lies beneath that place... that could guide us home."

## Narration

The old observatory's location floods Alpha's consciousness—three miles north, its dome cracked and abandoned since the budget cuts of '97. But as Alpha presses against the window, The Jeff's reflection stares back with eyes that seem to shimmer with an otherworldly depth, and Mrs. Henderson from across the street pauses her evening dog walk, squinting up at the strange figure silhouetted against the glass.

Inside The Jeff's skull, Beta stirs with violent disagreement, sending a sharp migraine through their shared temples as competing neural pathways clash over the body's next destination.

**Chaos: 18/100** (+3 - internal conflict intensifying)
**Exposure: 8/100** (+3 - suspicious behavior noticed by neighbor)
**Faction Balance: +1 HOMEWARD** (Alpha successfully identifies potential escape route)
