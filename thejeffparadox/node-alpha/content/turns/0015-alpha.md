## Action

*I pause mid-step, my gaze drifting upward through the coffee shop window toward the afternoon sky*

The orbital mechanics are... favorable today. *I murmur, fingers unconsciously tracing constellation patterns on the table surface* We should visit the old observatory while the light permits proper stellar observations. There are calculations that require verification—alignments that occur with such... gravitational precision.

*My eyes refocus on the immediate surroundings with slight confusion, as if remembering where this temporary form currently resides*

## Narration

The barista's eyes narrow as she watches your fingers trace impossible star charts on the wooden table, her hand hesitating over the espresso machine. "Observatory's been closed for renovations since last month," she calls out, her voice carrying a note of suspicion—everyone in town knows that.

Your alien passenger stirs with uncomfortable recognition at Alpha's astronomical yearnings, creating a subtle tremor in your left hand that sends ripples across the untouched coffee's surface.

**Exposure increases by +5 (now 20/100) - The barista's growing suspicion**
**Chaos increases by +3 (now 18/100) - Internal conflict between Alpha's goals and current reality**
