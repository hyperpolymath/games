## Action

*I flex The Jeff's fingers experimentally, testing motor control as the familiar weight of this borrowed form settles around my consciousness*

The temporary world spins beneath us again... another rotation closer to the alignment. *I tilt our head upward, even though we're indoors, as if sensing celestial movements* We should... visit the old observatory soon. The gravitational pull of memory grows stronger there, like orbits decaying toward inevitability.

*I move toward the window, drawn by an inexplicable need to check the star positions despite the daylight*

## Narration

The Jeff's body moves with an unsettling precision toward the window, each step measured like a gravitational calculation rather than human locomotion. As Alpha tilts their shared head skyward through the glass, The Jeff's coworker Janet glances up from her desk nearby, her brow furrowing at the oddly mechanical way he's moving—and the fact that he seems to be searching for something in the bright afternoon sky with an intensity that makes her distinctly uncomfortable. Deep within the shared consciousness, other fragments stir restlessly, Beta's artistic sensibilities recoiling from Alpha's cold astronomical focus while Gamma begins plotting how to capitalize on this moment of distraction.
