## Action

*I pause, tilting our shared head toward the window where stars are becoming visible in the darkening sky*

The alignment approaches... we can feel it in the gravitational pull of distant bodies. *My voice carries a wistful quality* This temporary world spins so predictably, yet we remain... tethered. Perhaps it's time to visit the old observatory—there are calculations there, star charts that might help us understand why the signals from home have grown so faint.

*I begin moving toward the door with purposeful steps* The night offers clarity that daylight obscures.

## Narration

The body moves with Alpha's characteristic fluid grace toward the door, but halfway there, a sudden dizzy spell strikes—the gravitational sensitivity that helps navigate between worlds proving overwhelming in Earth's dense atmosphere. *Our vision blurs momentarily, and I have to steady myself against the doorframe, fingers gripping wood with slightly too much force, leaving small indentations.*

A neighbor's porch light flickers on across the street, and Mrs. Henderson's silhouette appears at her window, clearly having noticed the unusual late-evening movement from the supposedly quiet household.

**Chaos: 18/100** (+3 - gravitational disorientation)
**Exposure: 8/100** (+3 - neighbor attention, suspicious timing)
