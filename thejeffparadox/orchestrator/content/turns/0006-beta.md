## Action

I feel the pull of Alpha's homesickness like a tide in our shared consciousness, but I resist its undertow. Instead, I focus on the sensation of morning sunlight warming this borrowed skin, the way coffee steam carries memories of countless human mornings before us.

"We should walk," I say aloud, addressing both Alpha and the possibility of nearby ears. "There's a community garden three blocks north—I've been watching the volunteers tend their plots, learning how humans nurture things that grow slowly, patiently, in foreign soil."

## Narration

The body moves with Beta's deliberate calm, but Alpha's homesickness creates an involuntary tremor in the left hand—a subtle betrayal that makes the coffee cup rattle against its saucer. A jogger passing the café window glances twice at the figure speaking to empty air, their pace slowing with curiosity before they continue on.

In the shared mindspace, Alpha's longing for distant stars grows stronger in response to Beta's grounding attempt, like a magnetic pull that threatens to fragment their carefully maintained human facade.

**UPDATED STATE:**
- Chaos: 18/100 (+3)
- Exposure: 7/100 (+2)  
- Faction Balance: -6 (Beta gaining slight advantage, but Alpha's resistance intensifying)
