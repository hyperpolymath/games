## Action

*I freeze mid-step, nostrils flaring as something ancient stirs in this borrowed neural pathways. The scent carries... coordinates? No, deeper than that—a gravitational pull toward something that predates this temporary assignment.*

"We... I recognize this." *My voice drops to barely above a whisper, eyes scanning the horizon with sudden urgency.* "Like stellar winds carrying messages across the void—there is something here that remembers the origin-place."

*I begin moving toward the source of the scent with deliberate, measured steps, one hand unconsciously reaching toward where the old observatory should be visible in the distance.*

## Narration

The scent grows stronger as Alpha approaches—not just familiar, but *impossibly* familiar, triggering cellular memories that predate Jeff's birth by millennia. The body's autonomic systems begin fluctuating wildly: pupils dilating beyond human norms, skin temperature dropping several degrees, and breathing patterns shifting to accommodate atmospheric compositions that don't exist on Earth.

A jogger passing nearby does a double-take at the strange, predatory grace of Alpha's movement and the way shadows seem to bend differently around the figure, muttering "weird..." as they pick up their pace to get away from whatever they just witnessed.

**Chaos: 15 → 25/100** (body strain from alien memories surfacing)
**Exposure: 5 → 15/100** (unusual behavior witnessed by civilian)
