## Action

*I flex The Jeff's fingers, feeling the warmth of blood beneath skin, and step closer to the nearest human—a barista wiping down tables with methodical care.*

"Excuse me," *I say, my voice carrying genuine curiosity,* "I've been watching how you clean that same spot three times now. Is there something satisfying about the repetition, or are you... tending to it, like nurturing something to grow?"

*I tilt The Jeff's head slightly, studying their face with an intensity that might seem odd, but hoping to glimpse that spark of recognition—the moment when someone sees past the surface and connects with what lies beneath.*

## Narration

The barista looks up, startled by the intensity of The Jeff's gaze, and takes an unconscious step backward. "I... what? It's just coffee stains," they stammer, their eyes darting between The Jeff's face and the exit, clearly unsettled by the strange phrasing about "nurturing something to grow."

Inside the shared mind, Alpha bristles with alarm—*This is exactly how we get discovered, you sentimental fool*—while Gamma finds the human's discomfort deliciously fascinating, already plotting how to escalate the tension.

**Exposure increases by +3 (now 8/100) - The overly intense observation and alien-like phrasing about "tending" raises suspicion.**
