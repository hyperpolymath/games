## Reporting a Vulnerability

### Preferred Method: GitHub Security Advisories

The preferred method for reporting security vulnerabilities is through GitHub's Security Advisory feature:

1. Navigate to [Report a Vulnerability](https://github.com/hyperpolymath/games/security/advisories/new)
2. Click **"Report a vulnerability"**
3. Complete the form with as much detail as possible
4. Submit — we'll receive a private notification

This method ensures:

- End-to-end encryption of your report
- Private discussion space for collaboration
- Coordinated disclosure tooling
- Automatic credit when the advisory is published

### Alternative: Encrypted Email

If you cannot use GitHub Security Advisories, you may email us directly:

| | |
|---|---|
| **Email** | jonathan.jewell@open.ac.uk |
| **PGP Key** | [Download Public Key](https://hyperpolymath.github.io/pgp.asc) |
| **Fingerprint** | `TBD` |

```bash
# Import our PGP key
curl -sSL https://hyperpolymath.github.io/pgp.asc | gpg --import

# Verify fingerprint
gpg --fingerprint jonathan.jewell@open.ac.uk

# Encrypt your report
gpg --armor --encrypt --recipient jonathan.jewell@open.ac.uk report.txt
```

> **Warning:** Do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues, pull requests, discussions, or social media.

---

## What to Include

A good vulnerability report helps us understand and reproduce the issue quickly.

### Required Information

- **Description**: Clear explanation of the vulnerability
- **Impact**: What an attacker could achieve (confidentiality, integrity, availability)
- **Affected versions**: Which versions/commits are affected
- **Reproduction steps**: Detailed steps to reproduce the issue

### Helpful Additional Information

- **Proof of concept**: Code, scripts, or screenshots demonstrating the vulnerability
- **Attack scenario**: Realistic attack scenario showing exploitability
- **CVSS score**: Your assessment of severity (use [CVSS 3.1 Calculator](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1))
- **CWE ID**: Common Weakness Enumeration identifier if known
- **Suggested fix**: If you have ideas for remediation
- **References**: Links to related vulnerabilities, research, or advisories

---

## Response Timeline

We commit to the following response times:

| Stage | Timeframe | Description |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| **Initial Response** | 48 hours | We acknowledge receipt and confirm we're investigating |
| **Triage** | 7 days | We assess severity, confirm the vulnerability, and estimate timeline |
| **Status Update** | Every 7 days | Regular updates on remediation progress |
| **Resolution** | 90 days | Target for fix development and release (complex issues may take longer) |
| **Disclosure** | 90 days | Public disclosure after fix is available (coordinated with you) |

> **Note:** These are targets, not guarantees. Complex vulnerabilities may require more time. We'll communicate openly about any delays.

---

## Disclosure Policy

We follow **coordinated disclosure** (also known as responsible disclosure):

1. **You report** the vulnerability privately
2. **We acknowledge** and begin investigation
3. **We develop** a fix and prepare a release
4. **We coordinate** disclosure timing with you
5. **We publish** security advisory and fix simultaneously
6. **You may publish** your research after disclosure

### Our Commitments

- We will not take legal action against researchers who follow this policy
- We will work with you to understand and resolve the issue
- We will credit you in the security advisory (unless you prefer anonymity)
- We will notify you before public disclosure
- We will publish advisories with sufficient detail for users to assess risk

### Your Commitments

- Report vulnerabilities promptly after discovery
- Give us reasonable time to address the issue before disclosure
- Do not access, modify, or delete data beyond what's necessary to demonstrate the vulnerability
- Do not degrade service availability (no DoS testing on production)
- Do not share vulnerability details with others until coordinated disclosure

---

## Scope

### In Scope

The following are within scope for security research:

- This repository (`hyperpolymath/games`) and all its code
- Official releases and packages published from this repository
- Documentation that could lead to security issues
- Build and deployment configurations in this repository
- Dependencies (report here, we'll coordinate with upstream)

### Out of Scope

The following are **not** in scope:

- Third-party services we integrate with (report directly to them)
- Social engineering attacks against maintainers
- Physical security
- Denial of service attacks against production infrastructure
- Spam, phishing, or other non-technical attacks
- Issues already reported or publicly known
- Theoretical vulnerabilities without proof of concept

---

## Safe Harbour

We support security research conducted in good faith.

### Our Promise

If you conduct security research in accordance with this policy:

- We will not initiate legal action against you
- We will not report your activity to law enforcement
- We will work with you in good faith to resolve issues
- We consider your research authorised under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA), UK Computer Misuse Act, and similar laws
- We waive any potential claim against you for circumvention of security controls

### Good Faith Requirements

To qualify for safe harbour, you must:

- Comply with this security policy
- Report vulnerabilities promptly
- Avoid privacy violations (do not access others' data)
- Avoid service degradation (no destructive testing)
- Not exploit vulnerabilities beyond proof-of-concept
- Not use vulnerabilities for profit (beyond bug bounties where offered)

---

## Recognition

We believe in recognising security researchers who help us improve.

### Hall of Fame

Researchers who report valid vulnerabilities will be acknowledged in our [Security Acknowledgments](SECURITY-ACKNOWLEDGMENTS.md) (unless they prefer anonymity).

## Security Best Practices

When using games, we recommend:

### General

- Keep dependencies up to date
- Use the latest stable release
- Subscribe to security notifications
- Review configuration against security documentation
- Follow principle of least privilege

### For Contributors
