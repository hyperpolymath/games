== Development Setup

[source,bash]
----
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/dicti0nary-attack.git
cd dicti0nary-attack

# Install in development mode
pip install -e .

# Install development dependencies
pip install pytest pytest-cov flake8 black isort

# Run tests
pytest
----

== Code Style

We follow PEP 8 with some modifications:

- _Line Length_: 127 characters max (relaxed from 79)
- _Formatting_: Use `black` for automatic formatting
- _Imports_: Use `isort` to organize imports
- _Docstrings_: Google-style docstrings

Format your code:

[source,bash]
----
# Auto-format with black
black src/ tests/

# Sort imports
isort src/ tests/

# Check with flake8
flake8 src/ tests/
----

== Testing Guidelines

All new features must include tests:

- _Unit Tests_: Test individual functions and classes
- _Integration Tests_: Test component interactions
- _Coverage_: Aim for >80% code coverage

Test file structure:

[source,python]
----
"""Tests for module_name."""

import pytest
from dicti0nary_attack.module import ClassName


class TestClassName:
    """Tests for ClassName."""

    def test_feature_description(self):
        """Test that feature works correctly."""
        # Arrange
        instance = ClassName()

        # Act
        result = instance.method()

        # Assert
        assert result == expected_value
----

== Documentation

Update documentation for:

- New features
- API changes
- Configuration options
- Usage examples

Documentation locations:
- `README.md` - Overview and quick start
- `docs/USAGE.md` - Detailed usage guide
- `docs/API.md` - API reference
- Code docstrings - Inline documentation

== Adding New Generators

To add a new password generator:

1. _Create generator file_: `src/dicti0nary_attack/generators/your_generator.py`

[source,python]
----
from dicti0nary_attack.generators.base import PasswordGenerator
from typing import Iterator, Optional

class YourGenerator(PasswordGenerator):
    def generate(self, count: Optional[int] = None) -> Iterator[str]:
        # Your implementation
        pass
----

2. _Add to __init__.py_: `src/dicti0nary_attack/generators/__init__.py`

3. _Write tests_: `tests/test_your_generator.py`

4. _Update CLI_: Add to `src/dicti0nary_attack/cli.py`

5. _Update documentation_

== Adding New Features

For substantial features:

1. _Discuss first_: Open an issue to discuss the feature
2. _Plan the implementation_: Outline your approach
3. _Break into commits_: Make logical, atomic commits
4. _Test thoroughly_: Include comprehensive tests
5. _Document completely_: Update all relevant docs

== Commit Message Guidelines

Use clear, descriptive commit messages:

[source,text]
----
Add feature: brief description

Detailed explanation of what changed and why.
Include any relevant context or breaking changes.

Closes #123
----

Format:
- _Add_: New features
- _Fix_: Bug fixes
- _Update_: Changes to existing features
- _Refactor_: Code improvements without functional changes
- _Docs_: Documentation updates
- _Test_: Test additions or changes

== Review Process

All pull requests go through review:

1. Automated tests must pass
2. Code review by maintainers
3. Discussion and potential revisions
4. Approval and merge
