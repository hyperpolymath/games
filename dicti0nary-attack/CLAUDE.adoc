= dicti0nary-attack

== Project Overview

dicti0nary-attack is a security research utility for password cracking that focuses on words NOT in traditional dictionaries. This is a humorous inversion of conventional dictionary attacks - instead of testing common dictionary words, this tool targets non-standard passwords.

== Purpose

This tool is designed for:
- Security research and education
- Authorized penetration testing
- Password strength analysis
- CTF (Capture The Flag) competitions
- Defensive security research

_Important_: This tool should only be used in authorized contexts with explicit permission. It is intended for ethical hacking, security auditing, and educational purposes.

== Project Status

This is an early-stage project with:
- README documentation established
- GPL v3 license in place
- Core implementation pending

== Development Guidelines

=== Security Considerations

- All code must be developed with security best practices
- Avoid introducing vulnerabilities (command injection, XSS, SQL injection, etc.)
- Document any security-sensitive functionality
- Include warnings about authorized use only

=== Code Structure

As this project develops, maintain clear separation between:
- Core password generation/testing logic
- Dictionary/wordlist management
- Output formatting and reporting
- Configuration handling

=== Testing Requirements

- Unit tests for core functionality
- Integration tests for wordlist processing
- Performance benchmarks for password generation
- Security testing to prevent misuse

=== Documentation

Maintain clear documentation for:
- Installation and setup
- Usage examples
- Configuration options
- Legal and ethical considerations

== Technology Stack

To be determined based on implementation needs. Consider:
- Python for rapid development and extensive library support
- Go for performance-critical components
- Rust for memory-safe, high-performance code

== License

This project is licensed under GPL v3. All contributions must comply with this license.

== Ethical Use Statement

This tool is intended solely for:
- Authorized security testing
- Educational purposes
- Security research with proper authorization
- Defensive security measures

Unauthorized access to systems is illegal. Always obtain explicit permission before testing any system you do not own.
