== Overview

This document defines the governance model for the Candy Crash driving licence preparation platform. It outlines decision-making processes, roles, responsibilities, and conflict resolution mechanisms in compliance with RSR (Rhodium Standard Repository) requirements.

== Governance Philosophy

Candy Crash operates under principles of:

* *Transparency*: All decisions documented and accessible
* *Meritocracy*: Contributions earn influence
* *Consensus-seeking*: Prefer agreement over authority
* *Reversibility*: Most decisions can be undone (see REVERSIBILITY.adoc)
* *Accountability*: Clear ownership and responsibility

== Organizational Structure

=== Tri-Perimeter Contribution Framework (TPCF)

Candy Crash implements the TPCF graduated trust model:

==== Perimeter 1: Core Maintainers

*Access Level*: Full repository access, deployment rights, security decisions

*Current Members*: See link:MAINTAINERS.adoc[MAINTAINERS.adoc]

*Responsibilities*:

* Final approval on architectural decisions
* Security vulnerability response
* Release management
* Maintainer succession planning
* Financial decisions (if funded)

*Requirements to Join*:

* 12+ months of sustained contribution
* Demonstrated technical expertise
* Community trust and positive reputation
* Unanimous approval from existing Perimeter 1 members
* Signed DCO (Developer Certificate of Origin)

==== Perimeter 2: Trusted Contributors

*Access Level*: Direct commit access to non-critical branches, review privileges

*Responsibilities*:

* Code review for Perimeter 3 contributions
* Feature development and bug fixes
* Documentation improvements
* Community support and mentorship

*Requirements to Join*:

* 3+ months of consistent contribution
* 10+ merged pull requests
* No code of conduct violations
* Majority approval from Perimeter 1

==== Perimeter 3: Community Contributors

*Access Level*: Fork and pull request workflow

*Responsibilities*:

* Bug reports and feature requests
* Pull request submissions
* Documentation feedback
* Community discussion participation

*Requirements to Join*:

* None - open to all
* Must follow link:CODE_OF_CONDUCT.adoc[Code of Conduct]

== Decision-Making Process

=== Minor Decisions

*Definition*: Bug fixes, documentation updates, refactoring without API changes

*Process*:

1. Single Perimeter 1 or Perimeter 2 maintainer approval
2. Automated CI/CD checks pass
3. Merge after 24-hour review period (emergency fixes exempt)

*Timeline*: 1-3 days

=== Major Decisions

*Definition*: New features, dependency changes, architectural modifications

*Process*:

1. RFC (Request for Comments) issue created
2. 7-day community discussion period
3. Majority vote from Perimeter 1 maintainers (>50%)
4. At least 2 Perimeter 1 approvals required
5. Changes documented in CHANGELOG.adoc

*Timeline*: 7-14 days

=== Critical Decisions

*Definition*: License changes, CoC modifications, maintainer removal, project archival

*Process*:

1. RFC with clear rationale
2. 14-day community discussion period
3. Unanimous consensus from Perimeter 1 (all active maintainers must approve)
4. Public record of decision in GOVERNANCE.adoc amendments

*Timeline*: 14-30 days

=== Emergency Security Decisions

*Definition*: Critical security vulnerabilities, immediate threat mitigation

*Process*:

1. Any Perimeter 1 maintainer may act immediately
2. Private security disclosure (see link:SECURITY.md[SECURITY.md])
3. Public disclosure after patch deployment (90-day maximum)
4. Retroactive review by other Perimeter 1 members

*Timeline*: Immediate action, 24-hour notification

== Voting Procedures

=== Eligible Voters

Only Perimeter 1 maintainers vote on major and critical decisions.

=== Voting Method

* GitHub issue comments with explicit "+1" (approve) or "-1" (reject)
* Silence = abstention (does not block)
* Voting period defined per decision type (see above)

=== Quorum

* Minor: 1 approval
* Major: >50% of active Perimeter 1 members
* Critical: 100% of active Perimeter 1 members

== Conflict Resolution

=== Level 1: Informal Resolution

Contributors attempt direct communication to resolve disagreements.

*Timeline*: 7 days

=== Level 2: Mediation

Uninvolved Perimeter 1 maintainer mediates discussion.

*Timeline*: 14 days

=== Level 3: Governance Vote

If mediation fails, issue escalated to Perimeter 1 vote.

*Timeline*: 7-day voting period

=== Level 4: Code of Conduct Enforcement

Violations handled per link:CODE_OF_CONDUCT.adoc[CODE_OF_CONDUCT.adoc].

== Maintainer Succession

=== Adding Maintainers

* Nominated by existing Perimeter 1 member
* Public nomination with contribution history
* 14-day discussion period
* Unanimous approval required
* Onboarding checklist completed

=== Removing Maintainers

*Voluntary*: Maintainer may step down at any time with 30-day notice.

*Involuntary*:

* Inactivity: No contribution for 12+ months triggers emeritus status
* CoC Violation: Unanimous vote after investigation
* Breach of Trust: Unanimous vote with documented rationale

=== Emeritus Status

Former maintainers granted honorary recognition without active responsibilities.

== Financial Governance

=== Revenue Sources (if applicable)

* Sponsorships (see link:FUNDING.yml[FUNDING.yml])
* Grants
* Donations

=== Financial Transparency

* Quarterly reports published
* All expenses documented
* Maintainer compensation policy (if funded)

=== Decision Authority

Financial decisions follow Critical Decision process (unanimous Perimeter 1 approval).

== Amendment Process

This governance model may be amended through the Critical Decision process:

1. Proposed amendment as RFC
2. 14-day discussion
3. Unanimous Perimeter 1 approval
4. Version number incremented
5. Announcement to community
