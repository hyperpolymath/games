== Overview

Candy Crash is designed with *reversibility* as a core principle. Every operation can be undone, every decision can be changed, and no action is permanently destructive. This document outlines how to reverse common operations.

== Why Reversibility Matters

* *Safety*: Mistakes don't cause permanent damage
* *Experimentation*: Try new approaches without fear
* *Learning*: Students can reset progress and retry
* *Trust*: Users maintain control over their data

== Git-Level Reversibility

=== Undo Last Commit (Not Pushed)

[source,bash]
----
git reset --soft HEAD~1  # Keep changes staged
git reset HEAD~1         # Keep changes unstaged
git reset --hard HEAD~1  # Discard changes (use with caution)
----

=== Undo Pushed Commit

[source,bash]
----
git revert <commit-hash>
git push
----

=== Restore Deleted File

[source,bash]
----
git checkout HEAD -- <filename>
# Or from specific commit:
git checkout <commit-hash> -- <filename>
----

== Database-Level Reversibility

=== Rails Migrations

All migrations can be rolled back:

[source,bash]
----
# Rollback last migration
rails db:rollback

# Rollback specific number of migrations
rails db:rollback STEP=3

# Rollback to specific version
rails db:migrate VERSION=20251122011736
----

=== Data Recovery

Deleted records are *soft-deleted* where possible:

* Users: Devise provides recoverable functionality
* Course enrollments: Can be re-enrolled
* Quiz attempts: History preserved (cannot delete attempts)

== Application-Level Reversibility

=== User Actions

[cols="3*", options="header"]
|===
|Action
|Reversal Method
|Limitations

|Enroll in course
|Admin can unenroll
|Progress lost

|Complete lesson
|Admin can mark incomplete
|Achievement may remain

|Submit quiz
|Retake quiz (new attempt)
|Previous attempt preserved

|Earn achievement
|Cannot revoke (by design)
|Achievements are permanent rewards

|Update profile
|Edit profile again
|Previous values not tracked
|===

=== Admin Actions

[cols="3*", options="header"]
|===
|Action
|Reversal Method
|Limitations

|Create course
|Delete or unpublish
|Student enrollments affected

|Publish course
|Set `published: false`
|Immediate effect

|Delete question
|Restore from Git history
|Manual process

|Ban user
|Update `user.active` flag
|Uses Devise lockable
|===

=== Instructor Actions

[cols="3*", options="header"]
|===
|Action
|Reversal Method
|Limitations

|Create lesson
|Delete or unpublish
|Student progress affected

|Create quiz
|Delete or unpublish
|Active attempts may fail

|Edit content
|Restore from Git (if tracked)
|No built-in versioning

== Code-Level Reversibility

=== Feature Flags

Critical features can be toggled without deployment:

[source,ruby]
----
# config/initializers/feature_flags.rb
FEATURES = {
  achievements: ENV.fetch('ENABLE_ACHIEVEMENTS', 'true') == 'true',
  gamification: ENV.fetch('ENABLE_GAMIFICATION', 'true') == 'true',
  social_features: ENV.fetch('ENABLE_SOCIAL', 'false') == 'true'
}
----

Disable a feature:

[source,bash]
----
ENABLE_ACHIEVEMENTS=false rails server
----

=== Database Seeds

Reset database to fresh state:

[source,bash]
----
# WARNING: Destructive in production
rails db:reset  # Drops DB, recreates, runs migrations, seeds
----

== Configuration Reversibility

=== Environment Variables

All configuration via ENV vars can be changed without code changes:

[source,bash]
----
# .env file (gitignored)
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...
SMTP_HOST=smtp.example.com
----

Change settings by editing `.env` and restarting.

=== Rails Credentials

Encrypted credentials can be rotated:

[source,bash]
----
# Edit credentials
EDITOR=nano rails credentials:edit

# Rotate master key (requires re-encryption)
rm config/master.key
rails credentials:edit  # Generates new key
----

== Data Export (Ultimate Reversibility)

Users can export their data at any time:

=== Student Data Export (Planned)

[source,ruby]
----
# Future feature:
# GET /profile/export
# Returns JSON with:
# - Profile information
# - Course enrollments
# - Lesson progress
# - Quiz attempts and scores
# - Achievements earned
----

=== Full Database Backup

[source,bash]
----
# PostgreSQL
pg_dump candy_crash_production > backup.sql

# SQLite (development)
sqlite3 db/development.sqlite3 .dump > backup.sql
----

=== Restore from Backup

[source,bash]
----
# PostgreSQL
psql candy_crash_production < backup.sql

# SQLite
sqlite3 db/development.sqlite3 < backup.sql
----

== Irreversible Operations (By Design)

Some operations are *intentionally irreversible* for data integrity:

=== Cannot Reverse

. *Achievement Unlocks*: Once earned, always earned (motivation psychology)
. *Quiz Attempt History*: Preserved for academic integrity
. *Audit Logs*: Security requirement (tamper-evidence)
. *Password Resets*: Previous password hashes discarded

=== Why These Are Irreversible

* *Achievements*: Reversing would undermine gamification
* *Quiz History*: Academic honesty requires immutable records
* *Audit Logs*: Security best practice
* *Passwords*: Security requirement (one-way hashing)

== Emergency Recovery

=== Lost Admin Access

[source,bash]
----
# Rails console
rails console
User.find_by(email: 'admin@example.com').update(role: :admin)
----

=== Corrupted Database

. Stop application
. Restore from last backup
. Replay WAL logs (PostgreSQL) or re-run migrations
. Verify data integrity
. Restart application

=== Accidental Deletion

. Check Git history: `git log -- <deleted_file>`
. Restore file: `git checkout <commit> -- <deleted_file>`
. If database: Restore from backup or use `rails db:rollback`

== Testing Reversibility

=== Development

[source,bash]
----
# Make changes
rails db:migrate

# Test reversal
rails db:rollback
rails db:migrate  # Should work identically
----

=== CI/CD

Automated tests verify migrations are reversible:

[source,bash]
----
# In .github/workflows/ci.yml
rails db:migrate
rails db:rollback
rails db:migrate  # Must succeed
----

== Best Practices

. *Always write reversible migrations* with proper `up` and `down` methods
. *Test rollback* before deploying migrations
. *Backup before major changes* (database, configuration)
. *Use Git tags* for release points
. *Document irreversible operations* clearly
. *Prefer soft deletes* over hard deletes for user data
. *Version APIs* to allow backward compatibility

== Future Enhancements

* [ ] Automated daily backups
* [ ] Point-in-time recovery (PostgreSQL)
* [ ] User data export API
* [ ] Content versioning for lessons/courses
* [ ] Audit log UI for administrators
* [ ] Undo queue for recent admin actions
